AWS Built-In (ABI) is a certified program conferred upon ISV Partners. It assists customers in effortlessly implementing third-party software that seamlessly integrates with AWS Native Services. The intended audience for this program includes customers seeking an all-in-one solution, as opposed to the complexities of independently installing, securing, and configuring AWS Native Services to leverage the full potential of third-party software. Partners with their own Built-In offerings provide tailored deployment packages where their solutions are intricately woven into AWS services using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This approach dramatically reduces the time customers would otherwise spend, transforming it from weeks into mere minutes. Consequently, it optimizes customer efficiency, expediting the deployment of new initiatives.

AWS Built-In partner solutions undertake the responsibility of installing, configuring, and harmonizing with core AWS services. They employ a well-structured Modular Code Repository (MCR) and offer automated deployment packages that have been meticulously reviewed and validated by AWS experts. This automation independently undergoes rigorous scrutiny by AWS, resulting in substantial time savings – an equivalent of hours, days, or even weeks in vendor integration testing.

By simplifying the integration process, we empower customers to unlock the full potential of foundational AWS native services while benefiting from the rich functionality of third-party solutions. Our primary aim is to deliver a unified and cohesive experience to customers, alleviating the complexities often associated with combining disparate software and data sources.

For instance, when a customer subscribes to an ISV partner product, they encounter a series of steps to transition from the subscription phase to full functionality. These steps encompass a mix of manual and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) procedures. These steps include enabling services like Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub, Amazon Inspector, and AWS CloudTrail, followed by additional actions such as incorporating AWS accounts and integrating with CloudTrail events, among other tasks on the partner SaaS product.

In comparison, this AWS Built-In package facilitates the integration of Deepwatch MDR with AWS Organizations on the AWS Cloud. It caters specifically to Deepwatch customers who utilize AWS CloudTrail and Amazon GuardDuty and seek to establish the essential resources for ingesting log sources for the Deepwatch MDR service across multiple AWS accounts.
